# Data Development Pathway with Python and SQL

## Overview

The first class is learning basic Python programming, along with version control (Git) to build a project of your choosing.

>INFO:  The coding world is challenging.  Imposter syndrome is real.  Self doubt is real.  Know that even experienced coders deal with this.  You are not alone.  Some days you will hate code, other days you feel invicible.  Breath, relax, we'll get through it together.
