# Data Development Pathway with Python and SQL
## This course starts off with learning about basic Python programming.

The first class is learning basic Python programming, along with version control (Git) to build a project of your choosing.

>INFO:  The coding world is challenging.  Imposter syndrome is real.  Self doubt is real.  Know that even experienced coders deal with this.  You are not alone.  Some days you will hate code, other days you feel invicible.  Breath, relax, we'll get through it together.



# Contributions
Whether you are a student, or mentor your pull requests are welcome.  If you are creating a new module, there is a [template](./modules/demo-template.md) to get you going.



# Class Schedules
Each class is following the same course syllabus, and therefor should be identical in they're lessons.  In reality, sometimes there are extenuating circustances that prevents the class from meeting, and the class must adjust.  To help with those adjustments, below are links to each class' schedule.  If you are not sure which module we are on, reference the schedule.

# Core Python and Git
## [Git and GitHub](./modules/git-github/README.md)
The goal of this demo is to learn a basic git workflow using a personal repository on GitHub to save and share your project.

## [Functions and Functional Programming](./modules/functions-and-functional-programming.md)
Functions, Variables, Data Types, Conditionals, Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Files, and Modules are the focus for this module.  

## [Classes and Object-orientation](./modules/classes-and-object-orientation.md)
Class attributes, methods, properties, inheritance/resolution order, decorators, nesting modules with packages, implementing packages, namespaces, package layout and distribution.

## [Importing data](./modules/importing-data.md)
To take advantage of the analytics libraries that exist for Python like NumPy, and Pandas you need data to analyse.  Let's look at a few ways to import data.

## [Iterators](./modules/iterators.md)
Iterators and Iterables, Collect Protocols, Container, Sized, Iterable, Sequence, Performance Refactors, Collection Base Classes, Set Protocol

## [Resource and Error Handling](./resource-and-error-handling.mdf)
Exceptions, Tracebacks, Assertions, Context Managers



# Data Analysis
With Python's vast Data Science library collection it is only fitting that we explore some of these powerful tools.  As a Data Analyst/Scientist, etc these libraries along with a creative mindset will be critical to your success.  Aside from the code, there are some general processes that are helpful to know when you're getting started.  Follow along in the subsequent modules to learn more.

## [Data Analyiss Process](./modules/data-analysis/data-analysis.md)
In this module we explore the process of breaking things down.

## [Project structures for data analysis](./modules/project-structures/project-structures.md)
Common directory layouts used while anaylyzing data.

## [CLI (command line interface) apps](./modules/command-line-apps.md)
Interacting with your app.
